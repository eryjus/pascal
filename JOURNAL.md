# Century Pascal Compiler

As always, this project will contain a journal of my work.  This is not intended to be a representation of the current state of the project.  On the other hand, this journal captures my thinking and decisions (and stupidity) as I work through this project.  I will make mistakes; read my journal so you do not make the same ones I did.
